								My Goals
							</h3>
							
							<p>
								I hope to inspire meaning to those around me and learn new things every day. 
								In a more tangible sense, I love to use data to tell a story. The story I aim to tell is that of progress, 
								hope, and community in being. We are all connected at our roots, and our differences birth oppenness to new
								ideas and innovation. It is this fundamental oneness and yet branching of the tree that begets
								progress. 
								<br> <br>
								In the past progress has spread through the humanities. Now, technology has been the leader of our growth. 
								But without morality-centric technological advancement, there is no true progress. My aim is to be a voice 
								in innovation focused on humanism. To celebrate our differences, to lead a good life, and to cherish 
								beauty, organization, design, and analysis.
							</p>



							<h3 class="major">
								Where I'm coming from
							</h3>
							<p>
								I am just a normal guy. But I am full of ambitions. Since forever ago, I have dreamt of designing and building homes, 
								creating apps, being a musician, and running a team of bright people. These are all unrelated endeavors in a sense, 
								but I think the principles that lead to success in one field overflow to others. 
								I have learned how to design and build greenhouses and pitch this business model to a group of 200 people to win 
								capital to fund this dream. This helped me grow a food pantry from an idea to serving 400 students in our first year.
								The principles of research, conceptualize, plan, reiterate, track and reflect apply to any idea or project of study.
								They flowed into my bands, where we were able to quickly learn new tracks, book shows, and get through the practical
								blockers of life with ease and get down to the business of fun. 
								<br>
								<br>
								The last few years, I have had my head down in the books and studying for my next opportunity. My past projects
								worked on small scale, but I wanted to find a way to make things scale. The slowdowns of tracking, reporting, and 
								manual measurement felt too ineffective to me. Questions of how to scale and automate the boring piqued my curiosity,
								and the world of data analytics had answers. Data storage, modeling, and automation have been my concepts 
								of focus to bring ideas to life with minimal friction. Utilizing Python and SQL, and leveraging the friend of technology,
								I hope to manage projects focused on humanism and create lasting change.

							<h3>Vroom</h3>
							<p>
								<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								I was on Business Intelligence team at Vroom focused on creating an efficient pipeline for reporting on business insights. 
								My focus was on the customer journey, including marketing acquisition, time spent on website, and experience with the process.

								I also worked part time for UACC, a Vroom subsidiary, where my focus was in automating excel reports using Domo. 
								<br> <br>
								- Built out an ETL pipeline using Redshift and dbt
								<br>
								- Funneled company wide data into Looker to create a self-service BI tool
								<br>
								- Converted recurring excel reports into automated Domo dashboards
								<br>
								- Presented and documented reports and new processes to share knowledge with the greater team
								<br> <br>
								We used our data pipeline to provide stakeholders with consistent, accurate, and automated metrics across bussiness
								processes. Reports that were once manually updated on a weekly basis now arrive before the workday begins each week.
								After automating these tasks, we could focus on deeper insights, including bottlenecks, logistics anomalies, 
								and purchasing trends that provide unique views into the how the business is operating.

							<h3>Stabilus</h3>
							<p>
								<!-- <span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								Engineering Technician turned Analyst: I developed a more in depth testing process and updated our diagnostic tracking system 
								to be more user-friendly, efficient, and automated - allowing trends and conclusions to be made right after test result input.

								<br> <br>
								- Ran force and diagnostic tests on parts to identify failure modes and root cause
								<br>
								- Leveraged Excel and SAP to build analytical models on failure modes to report to application engineers, focused on fixing issues for future product iterations
								<br>
								- Created more efficient warranty work flow process
								<br> <br>
								The focus at Stabilus was in optimizing the warranty process. When I began, we were receiving around 10 parts a week,
								mainly focused on water intrusion. As our parts became more complex, and the US team grew, we were receiving 40-100 parts
								a week and lacked an efficient and effective process to identify root causes. My work focused on developing a more in depth procedure,
								a tracking system in order to communicate results to engineers, and models to identify trends in our data.

							<h3>Revolve Farms</h3>
							<p>
								<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								Energy efficient, year-round greenhouses designed for the Midwest: I was the CEO and Co-Founder of Revolve Farms, a startup 
								that designs and builds greenhouses that enable food to be grown year-round in cold climates. We utilized passive solar and scalable 
								building technologies to create a product that was scalable, innovative, and had impact on the surrounding community.

								<br> <br>
								- Lead ideation, design, business operations, and marketing process to launch a sustainable agriculture technology company focused on building healthy communities 
								<br>
								- Developed and pitched business model and was awarded $40,000 of startup capital at CMU's New Venture Competition
								<br>
								- Built full-scale, working prototype to test technologies 
								<br> <br>
								Revolve was a business built to serve a need - connecting people to the food they eat. Its purpose was to create a space
								for people to grow food and relax. A beautiful idea that had issues scaling, so we stopped building in 2019.

							<h3>CMU Student Food Pantry</h3>
							<p>
								<!-- <span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								I brought the Student Food Pantry from Ideation to serving over 400 students in its first year.
								<br> <br>
								- Marketed the pantry's distribution dates, gather volunteers, and receive donations for food costs
								<br>
								- Hired and oversaw a committee that lead donation drives
								<br>
								- Worked with the Nutrition Club to create healthy meal plans for our recipientsBrought
							</p>
							<br>
							<br>


							<h3>CMU Student Government</h3>
							<p>
								<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								I was a part of the student senate and leader of the sustainability committee where we met weekly to 
								discuss and vote on legislation to improve the lives of students at Central Michigan University.
								<br> <br>
								- Lead a committee of student representatives for Student Government
								<br>
								- Posted weekly conservation tips for the student body 
								<br>
								- Passed legislation focused on making campus and the surrounding community more sustainable
